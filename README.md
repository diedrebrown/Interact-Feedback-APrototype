# Interact/Feedback: A Prototype
A BBC:microbit textile installation prototype made in Python for INFO 697 at Pratt Institute School of Information
1.	Create radio based signal codes for the micro:bit in the Python Mu Editor or the micro:bit web editor for Python.
2.	Table Top Micro:Bit
- To this micro:bit three sensors are attached: the PIR motion sensor, the capacitive touch sensor, and a digital white light. Place the motion sensor so that it is uppermost but not readily visible.
- If the micro:bit is not sensing activity near it, it will attempt to generate some by illuminating the morse code for ‘Z’.
3.	Radio
- On test to understand the range of the radio, I found that on Power 4 the radio were still communicating with each other while separated approximately 530 feet outdoors. 
 
4.	Hanging Micro:Bit 
- To this micro:bit conductive thread was used to connect three LEDs and a resistor.
